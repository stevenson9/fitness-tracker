# Gym Tracker :memo:

### Keep track of your gains! :muscle:
<br>

I will be creating an application that allows 
users to keep track of their workout routine 
from day to day. This app will keep track of things like
**when** you last went to the gym, to how **many** sets and reps 
of a certain exercise you did. This app will be able to
target **any** audience interested in keeping track of their 
**gains!** 

When working out, it is very important to **progressively
overload** *(lifting a little more/heavier each
session)* your exercises.
As someone who goes to the gym quite frequently
I always find myself wondering at what weight I conducted
some exercises the previous workout. While I could write 
down my progress on paper or on a notes app, it
just isn't very practical, and that's why I decided it'd be
fun to create my own **progress tracker**.

### User Story

- **As a user**, I want to be able to add exercises to the corresponding day :clipboard:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to select common exercises or add my own :green_book:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to record details of certain exercises freely *(reps sets time weight)* :wrench:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to easily see my progress in a certain exercise :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- **As a user**, Whenever I quit the app, I want to have the option to save my progress as a file
- **As a suer**, Whenever I start the app, I want to have the option to load in my progress with a file

### Phase 4: Task 3

If I had more time to work on this project, I would most likely
refactor a lot of my "ListOf__" classes so that they would extend an abstract 
or interface class as there is a lot of repeated code shared between these two classes. Furthermore,
using one of the design patterns learned in class, I would possibly
explore another way of designing my application, rather than having the 
classes I have right now. As for my UI package, I would attempt to
refactor a lot of the Java Swing code so that it is more readable, as it is fairly unorganized
at the moment.
