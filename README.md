# Gym Tracker :memo:

### Keep track of your gains! :muscle:
<br>

I will be creating an application that allows 
users to keep track of their workout routine 
from day to day. This app will keep track of things like
**when** you last went to the gym, to how **many** sets and reps 
of a certain exercise you did. This app will be able to
target **any** audience interested in keeping track of their 
**gains!** 

When working out, it is very important to **progressively
overload** *(lifting a little more/heavier each
session)* your exercises.
As someone who goes to the gym quite frequently
I always find myself wondering at what weight I conducted
some exercises the previous workout. While I could write 
down my progress on paper or on a notes app, it
just isn't very practical, and that's why I decided it'd be
fun to create my own **progress tracker**.

### User Story

- **As a user**, I want to be able to add exercises to the corresponding day :clipboard:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to select common exercises or add my own :green_book:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to record details of certain exercises freely *(reps sets time weight)* :wrench:
- **As a user**, I want to be able to easily see my progress in a certain exercise :chart_with_upwards_trend:
